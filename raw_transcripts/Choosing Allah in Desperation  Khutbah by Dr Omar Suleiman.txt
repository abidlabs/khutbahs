 We begin by praising Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala and bearing witness that none has the right to be worshipped or unconditionally obeyed except for him And we bear witness that Muhammad sallallahu alayhi wasallam is his final messenger We ask Allah to send his peace and blessings upon him the prophets and messengers that came before him His family and companions that served alongside him and those that follow in his blessed path until the day of judgment And we ask Allah to make us amongst them. Allahumma ameen Dear brothers and sisters in our Tuesday night classes. We've been going over the lessons of the firsts As-sabiqoon, al-awwaloon, the first companions, the first to stand with the Prophet sallallahu alayhi wasallam in the wake of many difficult circumstances And who sacrificed their lives and I mentioned two weeks ago that I was going to save one companion for a khutbah We spoke about what is known as hadithatul rajeer. So consider this a bonus session Hadithatul rajeer was a Hadithatul rajeer was the massacre of six or ten unsuspecting companions in the wake of Uhud alongside Bi'r Ma'una In which over 70 companions were massacred after Uhud and that caused great devastation to the Prophet sallallahu alayhi wasallam And we've spoken about five of the six. We spoke about Asim ibn Thabit. We spoke about Khalid ibn Bukair We spoke about Abdullah ibn Tariq. We talked about Khubayb ibn Adi and we spoke about Zayd ibn Dathina And we left out this one companion and as I mentioned we are going to speak about him today bi'idhnillahi ta'ala And his name is Marthad ibn Abi Marthad And the reason why he is such an interesting character is because he offers yet another complexity To the situation of these early Muslims who immediately found themselves in situations in which they were not able to To negotiate their taqwa with difficulties that were arising in real time And so you have this companion radiallahu ta'ala anhu and I won't go into too much detail because it is khutbatul jum'ah Marthad and his father were both actually Meccan and they became Muslim together And Marthad was a handsome well-built young man And he was someone who immediately dedicates himself to the Prophet sallallahu alayhi wasallam He was a Khalif of Hamza radiallahu ta'ala anhu and he was a Muslim And he was a friend of the Prophet sallallahu alayhi wasallam in Mecca and ally of Hamza ibn Abdul Muttalib in Mecca And in Medina he became the brother of Al-Aws ibn Samit radiallahu ta'ala anhu The great Ansari, the brother of Ubadat ibn Samit radiallahu ta'ala anhu Now he has a very specific role in the seerah and that is that he is the man That the Prophet sallallahu alayhi wasallam used to send on missions from Medina to rescue the poor prisoners in Mecca So he is Meccan but he is strong, he is smart, he is a good man He is smart, he knows Mecca inside out And the Prophet sallallahu alayhi wasallam gives him this task where he will send him to Medina on multiple missions Send him from Medina on multiple missions He will basically park his camel in a place called Al-Idkhir or his horse or whatever it is that he was using to transport the prisoners He goes deep into Mecca, rescues someone, brings them back and then takes them back to Medina Talk about a noble man, talk about the courage that he has to have to be able to do that So this hadith is in a Tirmidhi, the story of his And it's narrated that كان رجلا يحمل الأسرى من مكة حتى يأتي بهم المدينة That Amr ibn Shu'aib radiallahu ta'ala anhu narrates from his father, from his grandfather That there was a man from Mecca that used to go to Mecca from Medina and rescue the prisoners on behalf of the Prophet sallallahu alayhi wasallam And on one of these trips كانت امرأة بغية بمكة يقال لها عناق There was a woman that didn't have the best reputation in terms of what she would do So she was an adulteress Basically she was someone who was known in Mecca for a very particular sin, the sin of Zina But then the hadith has a twist to it وكانت صديقة له She was prior to the days of Islam his friend And his friend clearly has different connotations here He knew her well in the days of Jahiliyyah In the days of ignorance before he became Muslim He used to have a relationship with her And he hadn't spoken to her since he became Muslim And Marthad is in Mecca on one of these missions from the Prophet sallallahu alayhi wasallam And he narrates the story in first person, it's an authentic hadith He says, so I came to the walls of Mecca on a well moonlit night So there was more light in this particular night from the moon Than other nights And he said that I found myself in the situation فأبصرت سواد الغلي She noticed me by my shadow Meaning she knew him so well that just his silhouette alone was enough to let her know that that was Marthad So Anaq called out to him and said Marthad, Marthad She called out multiple times And he's on a mission here, right? He's compromised here, he's dead So Marthad comes up to her And he says, yes it's Marthad And Anaq says يَا مَرْحَبَ وَأَهْلَ هَلُمَّ فَبِتْ عِنْدَنَا اللَّيْلَ Welcome back to Mecca, oh Marthad, come spend the night with me He has a snap judgment to make here This isn't just zina but this is the test of Yusuf as well It's zina or potential death It's adultery or death He has a million excuses that he could make right now for himself And he actually does have an attachment to her from before So the attachment is there The threat is there And if he does not respond to her Then what could she do? She could then really compromise his security But he responds to her And he says, ya Anaq, haram allahu zina Anaq, listen, I'm a Muslim now I don't do that anymore And Allah has made zina haram Allah has made adultery haram So what does she do? Marthad says that she says She screams out Ya Ahlul Khyam Oh people of the tents The man who's been stealing your prisoners is here So his security immediately becomes compromised Marthad says, so I immediately ran away And he said, eight people pursued me And he said, until I found And it was night time Until I found a cave And I got into this cave And he said, technically speaking they found me Now SubhanAllah the hadith is very explicit He says that until they were right above me And when one of them urinated The urine hit my head I was that close You can imagine the fear that he has I'm dead I'm dead They're right there But he says, miraculously Allah Subhanahu wa ta'ala blinded them from actually seeing me I mean they were right there, right on top of me They could have taken me Allah who protected the messenger In the cave of the Hijrah Protected Marthad So Marthad said they left Alhamdulillah Then he said what? He said, so I went back into Mecca And I rescued the prisoner that the prophet Sent me to rescue Because I didn't know what to do He sent me to rescue Because I didn't want to go back to the prophet Empty handed This is Taqwa In and of itself Could have come back to the prophet I got caught Things got messy He said I went back And he said and I got the prisoner And he said and this prisoner happened to be a particularly heavy prisoner So he exhausted me I carried him out of Mecca And people already knew that I was somewhere around So there's a high alert for me And I carried him And I got to Idkhir And he said and I unshackled him And I put him on my camel And we made our way to Mecca And we made our way back to Medina He gets to the prophet And he tells the prophet What happened Now all of the things That you think he might ask the prophet Here's something that makes his story the most interesting And this is why you find the commentary of the ulama on it This woman Anaq Just tried to have him killed And what does Mertad ask the prophet? He says Ya Rasulallah Ankih Anaqa Can I go back and marry her? Ya Rasulallah Can I go back and ask her to marry me? Now Subhanallah This shows you by the way That Islam was difficult on these people in so many different ways Right? Suddenly they had a lifestyle change They were used to zina They were used to khamar They were used to alcohol Adultery They were used to partying They were used to so many different things And they were used to the same things They were used to the same things They were used to the same things They were used to so many different things But now Islam comes and makes all of that haram in an instant And he's a noble man And this woman just tried to do that to him But his heart was still attached to her And he says to the prophet Ankih Anaqa Can I go and I marry her? And the prophet was silent And he said it again to the prophet And the prophet was still silent So Mertad kind of got the point That the prophet is not answering me So either he didn't like the question Or the prophet is waiting for an answer from the heavens The ulama say look here This is again a testament to the man's taqwa Could have come to the prophet Don't we always have people That get into a haram relationship And try to halalify it all of a sudden? And they come and force the families Force everybody and say Hey look you know I'm making it halal now Right? Could have come to the prophet And he could have said Ya Rasulallah I abstained I didn't commit zina I didn't do anything haram I was on a noble mission Now you know inshaAllah she can take shahad And we'll be alright No none of that He waits for the answer from the prophet Until the prophet receives Quran from the heavens The ayah comes down So next time you read this ayah I want you to understand what the context was The ayah comes down Az-Zani la yankihu illa zaniya aw mushrika That an adulterer does not marry Except an adulteress Or a disbeliever And the same is true Az-Zaniya la yankihu illa zaniya aw mushrika That an adulteress woman does not marry Except for an adulterer man Or a disbelieving man Wa hurri ma thalika ala al-mu'mineena And this has been made prohibited to the believers Meaning what? The answer is no O Marthad And when the prophet comes back to Marthad With an ayah of Quran that came down for him Marthad could have said But ya Rasulallah What about this and what about that The Shaytan knows how to play with people in these states He's desperate He could easily be exploited in this vulnerability And Shaytan loves to take a person In a temporary vulnerability And make them make such a bad decision That they can't recover from it That's what he does Take you in your desperation Make you make a bad decision Try to cover up a sin with a sin Try to cover up a lie with a lie And you keep digging yourself deeper and deeper and deeper That's the story of Barsisa The priest from Bani Israel That he got himself into trouble Committed Zina And then he killed the lady Right? Because that's what the Shaytan told him Now you've got to cover your tracks But what does Marthad do? Marthad takes joy in this ayah Because Allah says at the end of the ayah Wa hurri ma thalika ala al-mu'mineena This has been made prohibited for the believers So what's the implication? Ana minal mu'mineena Allah just referred to me as a mu'min Therefore I take joy in being a mu'min And he goes back to work And what does Allah honor him with? He's a Badri He's one of the people who fought in Badr He's the one person who the Prophet entrusted to be that man To go into Mecca and to pull those prisoners He fights in Uhud And he becomes one of the greatest shuhada Because that class of the shuhada of Al-Rajee' Are some of the most special and beloved ones And they are the beloved companions to the Prophet Dear brothers and sisters The ulema say about this story That Marthad checks many boxes that were otherwise theoretical to us And as we continue on Tuesday nights We're going to talk about the murderers of Rajee' And their tawbah But Marthad checks many of them And one of the things that we learn from his story That is incredibly beneficial and useful Is that when the Prophet talks about the seven people Who were killed by the Prophet He talks about the seven people shaded under the throne of Allah All six of the categories that the Prophet mentions Of the seven Are categories of Ihsan Categories of people that did an extra act of good When they found themselves in a situation They beautified their deeds And there's one person Who was a man that was called to zina Da'atu imra'a dhatah hasabin wa jamal Who was called to adultery By a woman of power and a woman of beauty And he said Inni akhaf Allah I fear Allah And Allah places him in that category Under the throne of Allah Under the shade of Allah On the day of judgment Dear brothers and sisters The ulama say that is the one category of the seven That is a category of taqwa Not a category of Ihsan A category of being God-fearing Not necessarily a category of doing extra For the sake of Allah And why is that significant? Because when you Are in a situation In which you are most vulnerable In which you are most desperate That is the easiest time for shaitan To play in your mind and to tell you Now you can twist a bit Now you can bend a bit Now this sin will save you Now you can do this Now you can do that You've got to do this now You've already done this And he'll sink you and sink you and sink you But what does Allah say? Wa man yataqillaha yaja'allahu makhraja Whoever fears Allah Allah will make a way out for them Whoever has taqwa of Allah Allah will make a way out for them That shaitan tells you That if you abide by Allah's way After having abandoned it Or finding yourself in a difficult situation Taqwa in those circumstances Is so much more beloved to Allah Than the regular circumstances You know how relevant this is To so many of the situations We see happening with the youth right now To so many of the situations That we see happening with the youth right now To so many of the situations Of people that get caught into a bad situation And what do they do? They make it worse They make the situation permanent by their sins You know how many times it happens with Because it's not just a person It's also a drug It's also something else that you get attached to The only way you can escape is this If you were to talk to the many young people right now That have passed away May Allah forgive them And make it easy for their parents Because of an accidental overdose And you could hear from them What were you thinking in those last moments? You know how many people find themselves exploited? Because a desperate mind Is the devil's playground And it's at that moment That if you can say إِنِّي أَخَافُ اللَّهِ No, I fear Allah أَتَّقُّ اللَّهِ I fear Allah And I will instead abide by the way of Allah Then Allah may honor you and I The way He honored this man مَرْثَدْ رضي الله تعالى عنه May Allah be pleased with him Be pleased with the companions And may Allah send his peace and blessings Upon our beloved Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم اللهم أمين أقول قولي هذا وأستغفر الله لي ولكم ورسالة للمسلمين فاستغفروا إنه الغفور الرحيم الحمد لله رب العالمين والصلاة والسلام على رسوله الكريم وعلى آله وصحبه أجمعين اللهم اغفر للمؤمنين والمؤمنات والمسلمين والمسلمات الأحياء منهم والأموات إنك سميع قريب مجيب الدعوات اللهم اغفر لنا وارحمنا وعفو عنا ولا تعذبنا ربنا ظلمنا أنفسنا وإن لم تغفر لنا وترحمنا لنكوننا من الخاسرين اللهم إنك عفو كريم تحب العفو فاعفو عنا اللهم اغفر لوالدينا رب ارحمهما كما ربونا صغارا ربنا هب لنا من أزواجنا وذرياتنا قرة أعين وجعلنا للمتقين إماما اللهم اصول إخواننا المستضعفين في مشارك الأرض ومغاربها اللهم اعز الإسلام والمسلمين وأذل الشرك والكاذبين ودمر أعداء الدين اللهم أهلك الظالمين بالظالمين وأخرجنا وإخواننا من بينهم سارمين عباد الله أن الله يأمر بالعد والإحسان وإيتاء بالقربى وينهى عن الفحشاء والمنكر والبغي يعذكم لعلكم تذكرون فاذكروا الله يذكركم واشكروه على نعماء يزد لكم ولذكر الله أكبر والله يعلم ما تصنعون وأقيم الصلاة
